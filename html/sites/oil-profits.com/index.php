                    <p>However, one area of trading that has still remained relatively inaccessible for people is oil trading. Despite being a resource that powers the global economy, a lot of people don’t know how to trade on it.</p>
                    <p>It’s not as heavily featured on broker sites like stocks, gold, or Bitcoin, which is why Oil Profit was established.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Why Oil?</h3>
                    <div class="quote">Oil is the most widely used source of energy on the planet. It accounts for around 40% of the world’s total energy consumption. It powers countries, economies, and even monarchies.</div>
                    <p>Even as the world makes a shift towards green and renewable energy, oil trading isn’t going anywhere. Countries like the US and Saudi Arabia are built on oil economies, meaning there is a chance that there is always going to be a vested interest in the resource.</p>
                    <p>Even if demand for oil decreases, so too does the supply. Oil is a scarce resource. There is only so much of it to go around before the wells all dry up. Therefore, it may be  relatively safe to assume that prices might go up.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">How Oil can Diversify Your Portfolio</h3>
                    <div class="quote">While you can certainly trade on oil exclusively, at Oil Profit you can use it to diversify your portfolio.</div>
                    <p>Some traders have a collection of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and perhaps a few commodities like gold and silver. Few of them have oil, and might be considered as a missed opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Companies are always capable of suddenly going bankrupt, whether because of  the 2020 pandemic or anything else, and crypto is still an unknown variable that makes up the most volatile market of them all. Neither of these is a safe investment, and oil isn’t either, trading is always a risky business.</p>
                    <p>Oil has been in high demand for decades, and it may continue its market and energy domination. It might be a relatively safe resource to invest in because there might always be a demand for it in some capacity, whether that be military or civil interest.</p>
                    <p>By diversifying your portfolio into oil, you can hopefully give yourself a lifeline that you can fall back on in case your other trades don’t work out.</p>

            <p>Signing up is very straightforward as well.

                    <p>If you’ve never traded oil before, it’s possible that no strategies you’ve used in the past are going to work in this market.</p>
                    <p>Oil might be considered by some as liquid gold but it takes on a life of its own in how it behaves. It’s influenced by politics, conflict, and consumption, a trio that very few other resources on earth can account for.</p>
                    <p>Instead, you can share your parameters and limitations with your account manager, ask for information and let him / her guide you through the basics, then you can dive into Oil Profit to continue learning and then try to implement your strategy.</p>

            <p>Oil simply does not work like other investments. Shares are subject to the performance of a company and sales figures, crypto is subject to anything from governments to celebrity tweets, and gold might be directly influenced by other markets.</p>
            <p>Oil trading is a cut above all of these. It is a market that is entwined with global politics that are played at the highest level. If you go into the oil market expecting things to be business as usual for you, you’re in for a surprise.</p>
            <p>Luckily for you, though, Oil Profit is here to help you navigate those turbulent waters.</p>

                    <p>Crude oil powers everything from ships to cars to factories, and the money produced from it even powers economies.</p>
                    <p>Without crude oil, the global infrastructure, as people know it, would cease to function. It has become a critical piece in society, and it’s a piece that you can get involved in.</p>

                        <p>Just make sure you work on building your knowledge and experience while you’re trading with the platform. There are countless different trading education resources online that you can take advantage of, and it’s best if you do.</p>
                        <p>By actively learning and trading with Oil Profit, you might be getting the kind of experience that is going to back up any theory you read. This might give you an advantage over other investors that are only reading about trading rather than actually doing it.</p>

                        <p>The global shift towards green energy isn’t a shift away from oil; it’s a shift because of it.</p>
                        <p>Remember, oil still powers over 40% of the world’s energy consumption. There’s a reason that you don’t see everybody driving Tesla cars. According to some experts, Oil is going to remain the fuel of choice for decades to come, regardless of what happens with green energy.</p>
                        <p>Oil is so powerful that it’s even charging the shift towards green energy. It might always be worth investing in the resource up until the last drop of it is pulled from the earth.</p>

                        <p>There are a lot of different investment opportunities out there, and it might be best to invest in as many variables as possible, but there’s one reason why oil is considered by some as superior: stability.</p>
                        <p>If the pandemic and the recent war in Ukraine have taught us anything, it’s that the global economy is never hanging on by anything more than a thread. However, throughout all of this, machines still needed power, homes still needed heat, and cars still needed petrol.</p>
                        <p>While companies can go bankrupt and currencies crash, oil continues pushing forward like an economic locomotive.</p>
                        <p>It’s proven itself to be one of the most interesting investments anyone can make, which is why some traders are investing in it over other resources.</p>
